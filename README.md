## One Project Overview

This repository contains notebooks and resources for evaluating and visualizing machine learning models.

### Notebooks

- **Main Notebook**: 
  - Contains the results report and code for model evaluation.

- **Experiment Notebook**: 
  - Includes code for model testing and experimentation with different datasets and models.

### TensorBoard Visualization

- The `./tf_embedding_projector` folder includes code and generated data for TensorBoard projector visualization.
- To start your own TensorBoard embedding projector visualization, refer to the `embedding_stuff.ipynb` notebook.

### Data Sources

We used a combination of scrapped and preexisting data. The scrapped data is available on Google Drive. Note that you will need LionMail to access these large files:
